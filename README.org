* Styx: a nix-based multi-repo Haskell project manager

"Styx: there is no looking back."

Styx is a convenient wrapper around ~cabal2nix~, ~nix-shell~ and
~cabal sandbox~.

** Installation

- get nix: https://nixos.org/nix/
- install the prerequisites (cabal2nix and cabal)

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  nix-env -f "<nixpkgs>" -iA haskellPackages.cabal2nix
  nix-env -f "<nixpkgs>" -iA haskellPackages.cabal-install
  #+END_SRC

- install styx:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  nix-env -f "<nixpkgs>" -iA haskellPackages.styx
  #+END_SRC


** Configuration

In a directory of your choice, create a ~styx.yaml~ file like so:


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

# List first the packages that you edit locally and want compiled "all the time", by cabal:
local-packages:
  my-main-package: # package name
    location: .    # location on your disk
  my-local-dep:    # package name
    location: dep  # location on your disk

# Optional: list patched or cutting edge packages that you depend on.
# These will be compiled only once, by nix.
source-deps:
  mtl:
    location: https://github.com/mrawesome/awsm-patched-version-of-mtl.git

# If you want you can add other haskell nix packages to depend on.
# Normally this is not necessary, because nix will track the dependencies on its own.
# Thus this section is mostly useful for throw-away projects which do not have a cabal file.
nix-deps:
    - criterion
    - gasp
    - lens
    - statistics

# In case you depend on other non-haskell tools or libs.
non-haskell-deps:
    - z3

# Optionally, one can ask for a specific version of nixpkgs:
nixpkgs:
  commit: 8ef3eaeb4e531929ec29a880cb4c67f790e5eb70
  sha256: 4d2fae900d2d99ea294f4f412289af77152ac21d7b2e9ff23581ef11ea00831f

# Optionally, one can ask for a specific version of ghc known by nixpkgs
default-compiler: ghc801
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then, the command

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
styx configure
#+END_SRC

will create one nix file for each external package, a suitable
~shell.nix~, and a sandbox with sources for every local-package.

** Use

You can then access the sandbox, inside the nix shell, like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC
nix-shell .styx/shell.nix --run "cabal ..."
#+END_SRC

Styx provides a couple of convenience commands:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ styx build # runs cabal install in the sandbox
$ styx repl # runs cabal repl in the sandbox
$ styx exec <cmd> # runs cabal exec in the sandbox
#+END_SRC

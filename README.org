* Styx: a nix-based multi-repo Haskell project manager

Styx: there is no looking back.

In its present form, Styx is a convenient wrapper around cabal2nix for
projects depending on external repos.

** How to use

In your cabal project, create a ~styx.yaml~ file like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
external-repos:
  mtl: https://github.com/jyp/my-patched-version-of-mtl.git
  containers: https://github.com/jyp/my-patched-version-of-containers.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

Run

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
styx configure
#+END_SRC

This will create one nix file for each of ~external-repos~, and a
suitable ~shell.nix~. You can then run ~nix-shell --run "cabal
configure"~ in an environment with the required dependencies (at the
right version).

- Support multiple cabal projects in a sandbox
